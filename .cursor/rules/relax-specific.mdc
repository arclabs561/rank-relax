# rank-relax Specific Rules

These rules extend the shared base rules with relax-specific guidelines.

## Algorithm-Specific

- **Soft ranking**: Smooth relaxations of discrete operations
- **Differentiable**: Gradient-based optimization support
- **ML frameworks**: Candle and Burn integration

## Data Sources

- Example data from `examples/complete_workflow.rs`
- Training data for differentiable ranking
- Convergence analysis from examples

## Testing

- Property tests verify mathematical properties
- Convergence tests verify optimization behavior
- Framework integration tests (Candle/Burn)

## Documentation

- Soft ranking formulas with convergence plots
- Training examples in `examples/candle_training.rs`
- Mathematical foundations in README
